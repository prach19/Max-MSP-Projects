# Max-MSP-Projects
All my works created with Max/MSP!

## Landslide - Visual Music Piece
- This piece explores the intersection of visual media and music through a transmodal composition created with Max/MSP 8. By using digital audio editing software to isolate the vocals from the instruments, custom Javascript elements and Max/MSP objects (like peakamp~), I created interactive algorithms which generates visuals that respond in real time to the structure of the song, thus creating an immersive sensory experience.

- This piece took about 3 weeks to complete, as well as extensive experimentation and research with Max/MSPâ€™s available messages and objects
